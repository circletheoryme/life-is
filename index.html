    <p class="first-paragraph">Ever wonder what the "big picture" for life is? I do too, this theory is backed by personal research and theories that I have collected over the years.
    My first year in college I was required to take a philosophy class, it started with the most basic of all questions..... "Is life a straight line or a circle?"; the assignmenet was to write an eight page paper explaining your "position" on the subject.</p>
    <p>Seems like an easy exercise...right? If you are thinking that then I suggest you try it yourself. Prior to this assignment I had believed, (and believed firmly), that life was undoubtably a straight line, a series of events that occured due to happenstance, free will and opportunites based on external environment.</p>
    <p>So I did what anyone would do, I started drafting this paper. Something happened along the way though...
    About five pages in , I realized that life wasn't a straight line afterall, I also relaized that it wasn't a circle either.
    Instead I had a "euruka moment", I realized that life can be proved as a series of cirlcles.</p>
    <p>In each stage of our lives we are given obstacles to overcome, if we give up we are doomed to repeat that cycle and to "live in that circle" as a type of purgatory, but once we conquer that challenge we move to another adjacent circle, we get a brand new challenge and we grow as human beings.</p>
